Some excercises to try out CILamp's during presentation 23rd of February 2017.

First, test changing your lamp using this command (the ID is written on the bottom of the lamp):

    python example_set_lamp.py

Then, go into your subfolder and look at the README.md for further instructions.

Note: if you want to have a virtual lamp on several laptops, you could check it out here:

	https://github.com/CILamp/vl

Then, running the lamp concurrently with the physical lamp like this:

	$ ./run -i system_e
